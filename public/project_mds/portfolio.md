## Quick Overview

This project is being built to learn a front end web framework as well as UI desing concepts and basics. I chose React since it's the most popular in the industry.\
The code currently is a mess because of the learning curve that react has. Especially when learning typescript at the same time.\
I also wanted to make a dynamic background for the experiance to feel less static, threeJS was chosen for this to be able to use a fragment shader.
